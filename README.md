A subscription based shoe store created using Vue3 and Vue Router.

This project is hosted on Netlify.

<h3>Description</h3>

This was created using Vue3 for the sole purpose of picking up and learning Vue. The further this app is created, the more complex I attempt to make it to further my learning.

Currently only the "Home", "About" and "Contact" page have been worked on. The contact page needs a form to be complete.

<h3>How It's Made:</h3>

This Project was created with: 
<ul>
<li>Vue Router</li>
<li>Vue3</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimizations</h3>

I plan to get all links working. Currently I am working on setting up a mock terms and conditions and a privacy policy page. The contact page is in need of a form and then I will also implement the shop and get the shopping cart functioning. Making this project also got me to learn a bit about Firebase because I would like to add some sort of login for the shop and possibly a guest account that only requires an email at checkout. I also plan to make adjustments to the nav bar on mobile devices.  

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Through creating this project I learned several Vue topics which include but are not limited to components, vue router, transitions, how to launch a vue application after it is built and so much more. I truly have developed a love for this framework and have recently spent most of my time working with it recently. I found something called Quasar which is an extension of Vue that I plan to delve into soon and I would also like to build a simple Svelte app as I have heard many good things about it.
