<h3>Description</h3>

This was created using Vue3 for the sole purpose of picking up and learning Vue. The further this app is created, the more complex I attempt to make it to further my learning.

Currently only the "Home", "About" and "Contact" page have been worked on. The contact page needs a form to be complete.
